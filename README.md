# LiveScope
As of now, a Full-Stack implementation of a dataset from CERN's opendata

> Built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Python** *(for ROOT to JSON conversion)* and **React** *(probably)*

## Learning Goals
This project is expected to help me:
- Deepen my understanding of scientific data structures (e.g. ROOT).
- Present complex data in clear and/or accessible formats.
-
